# Tuberculosis-X-Ray-Image-Classification
Our problem is a binary image classification problem, meaning a classification model predicts whether an  image belongs to either of two labels (1 or 0). In our case, the two target labels are ‘Normal’ and  ‘Tuberculosis’; where Normal is represented by 0 and Tuberculosis is represented by 1.
